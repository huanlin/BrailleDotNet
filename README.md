# BrailleDotNet

BrailleDotNet is a Braille library for .NET.

BrailleDotNet aims to support text-to-braille conversion for two languages: English and Traditional Chinese.

- English: Unified English Braille (UEB)
- Traditional Chinese: Taiwanese Braille (台灣點字, also known as 國語點字)

## Target platforms

This project targets the following .NET platforms:

- .NET 8.0

## Roadmap

The first milestone is to define text-to-braille mappings in YAML files. However, there is no specific schedule for release, I'll just see what I can do when I have time.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute via pull requests. 

1. Please create one pull request for each feature. This results in smaller pull requests that are easier to review and validate.
2. Avoid reformatting existing code unless you are making other changes to it.
3. Unless the implementation is self-explanatory, please describe the why and how behind the pull request (in English or Chinese).
