# Text Braille Converter

A text to braille converter library.

Planned to support the following languages:

- English: Unified English Braille (UEB)
- Traditional Chinese

The first milestone is to define text-to-braille mappings in data files.

There is no specific schedule for release, I'll just see what I can do when I have time.
